Today's page is a type of simple puzzle the [Wolf, Cabbage, Sheep
Puzzle.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox,_goose_and_bag_of_beans_puzzle)

It is also known as the fox, goose, and bag of beans puzzle. The goal of the
puzzle is for a farmer to get the animals (and token
[vegetable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage)/[legume](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean))
from one bank to the other taking them across one at a time.  However if the
farmer leaves the wolf/fox with the sheep/goose or the sheep/goose with the
cabbage/bean obvious problems will occur.

Which allows me to conclude that sheep/geese are a serious problem for
migratory farmer who find them bridge-less. Although they could probably do
without the wolf/fox anyways.
