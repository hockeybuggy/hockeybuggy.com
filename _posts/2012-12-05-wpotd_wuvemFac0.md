Today's page is actually a Wiktionary page and not a wikipedia page but I hope
that the reader can forgive me.

[Xe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/xe) is a gender neutral pronoun. It can be
used in place of he. I really injoy the possessive (xyr or xir) and the
reflexive (xyrself).

An example of when this is useful is when talking about the space pope. Xyr
eminence would be a great way to address the leader of the intergalactic
catholic empire. If that ever comes up.

For other [gender-neutral pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun)
 there is another great page for it.
