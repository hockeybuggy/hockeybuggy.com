Today's wikipedia page is about the amazing [Graça Machel][page]. This amazing
woman has been both the first lady of Mozambique (Samora Machel) and the first
lady of South Africa (Nelson Mandela 1998-1999). She remained married to Nelson
Mandela until his death in 2013.

While some may people consider it a sad testament that her power is derived
from her husbands rather then her own actions but I think that Graça should
still be admired for her own merits.
