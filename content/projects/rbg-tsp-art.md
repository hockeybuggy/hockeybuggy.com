This is a creative project that I am very proud of and isn't software.
Traveling Salesperson is problem when "given a list of cities what is the
shortest distance between them". The lines generated this way have a nice
quality where the they very rarely intersect. This means that you can create a
stippled version of an image and create a image that looks like a single line
version of the original image. I used this approach on a colour component
version of an image and produced image that I eventually plotted using a XY pen
plotter.
