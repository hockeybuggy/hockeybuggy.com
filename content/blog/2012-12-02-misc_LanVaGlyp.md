title: Taking this Pelican site live
---

It is finally time to publish this website. I do not imagine that it is anyway
complete. However I really do want to have something existent up and online.

Things that still need to happened for the site is it still needs a slightly
nicer colour scheme. I however do not really have an overwhelmingly strong
sense of style.
