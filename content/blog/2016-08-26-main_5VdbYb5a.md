In May, I switched to using relative line numbers in Vim and I thought I should
share a bit about my experiences. In preemptive summary, my impression so far
is "OMG where have you been all my life relative numbers!".

## In the beginning

Many people that I see using Vim have this in their `.vimrc`:

``` VimL
  set number  " Show absolute line numbers in the gutter starting from line one
```

Seeing line numbers in Vim is fantastic. So fantastic it should really be
default on. It gives you an idea of where you are in a file, particularly if
you've just jumped there from a search, and are a little disoriented. This seemed
indispensable until I switched, but then realized that I didn't miss it.

In the gif above to delete the method I am pressing `Vjjjjd` for **V**isual-line
mode, down, down down, down, **d**elete. That's a lot of keys and I have to hold
the shift key. Gross.

## The enlightenment

Turing on relative line number makes me feel like I am jumping around like a
ninja&trade;. By giving `j` and `k` a count, you don't have to feel like you're
mashing them just to get where you want.

``` VimL
  set relativenumber  " Show line numbers relative to the location of the cursor
```

In the gif above, I am deleting the same method with `d3j`. This is **d**elete and
then the motion "3 down". It's easy to tell how many times I need to move down
while in relative line mode, since it's written in the gutter. This solution
takes three lowercase keystrokes compared to the visual mode solution that took
6 mixed case keystrokes.

## Overcoming the downsides

One of the down sides of the alternate line numbering system is that it can be
harder to find your absolute position. For example, if you have a test that is
failing, you'd want to jump to the line that is causing an error. Without absolute
line numbers, this can seem harder, however the Ex command `:123` will jump
straight to line 123.

When you really want to switch back to seeing the absolute line numbers running
`:set num` is enough to switch back. Alternatively, using the
[unimpaired][UNIMPAIRED] plugin you can switch between the two numbering
schemes with `con` and `cor`. A good mnemoic for these are "**c**hange **o**ption
**n**umber" and "**c**hange **o**ption **r**elative number"

## TL;DR;

If you haven't tried out relative line numbers in Vim, it give a shot.
