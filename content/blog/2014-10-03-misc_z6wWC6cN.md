Whenever I tell someone what my email is, I get asked about the name
hockeybuggy.

## Back in the day

At the beginning of time[^1], gmail did not exist. On April 1st of 2004 Google
announced the Gmail beta. At first the beta was invite only. Once you were
invited to get a Gmail account, you received 10 invites you could send others.

On January 31st 2005, I received an invite from my older sister. I discovered
the day that I created my account using the helpful advice of [this
page][CREATION_DATE_METHOD].

Being young I foolishly did not get douglasanderson&#64;gmail.com. Instead, I
got hockeybuggy&#64;gmail.com, a combination of my favourite sport at the time:
**hockey** and a modification of a nickname: **buggy**[^2]

## Why Keep It?

I have the name just about everywhere on the web. Since I have the .com  as
well as the same username on Github, Google, and Twitter and just about
everywhere else, I don't think I will be changing it any time soon.
