While it is April fools the [Ferriman-Gallwey
score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferriman%E2%80%93Gallwey_score) is no joke.
I bet you did not know that there was a scale to measure excessive hairiness
(specifically [Hirsutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism)) on a women.

Well now you do. Would you say your life better, worse or the same?
